Credit card fraud is a major issue for both consumers and financial institutions. With the increasing use of credit cards for online transactions, it has become more important than ever to develop effective fraud detection techniques.
 In this project, we will explore the use of machine learning with Python to detect credit card fraud. We will start by preprocessing the data and performing exploratory data analysis. Then, we will select the most relevant features and choose the best model for the task. 
After training the model, we will evaluate its performance and tune its hyperparameters. Finally, we will test the model and analyze the results.
